A. I am the only one in my group

B. I would like to create a 3D raytracing of the Mandelbrot set which is one of the suggestion projects on the project guideline paper.
I have started researching where I should start and have found a couple of sources including a python only based raytracing 
approach that I have cited below. In order to begin designing this program I will approach the design element first by identifying 
my goal: to render a 400x300 pixel image of a Mandelbrot figure using raytracing techniques. I will mainly use python and have 
begun to research resources that might help in the set up of the Mandelbrot set as well as the implementation of the raytracing 
technique. I have included the citations for the resources below.

C. Will not be needing any additional hardwar.

D.Will be using the following:

    a.Blender for python. 
    b.Matplotlib 
    c.Mandelbulb
    
E.I will be writing a python programing first screating a 3d Mandelbrot object then use raytracing to render an image of the at obect.
The program will first take at least 100 iterations of the Mandelbrot then the second part will have to do with the raytracing.

F. I will finish preliminaries by MONDAY. Have the first part, concerning the 3D Mandelbrot, done be week 5. I will have the raytracing
done by the end of week 5 which should give me time to polish the program.
