##Explain the function of the dfr alias that has been installed on your RPi.





The alias dfr is written as:

"find dfr='find . -maxdepth 1 -mtime -1 -o -ctime -1'

The find is a command that searches the directory tree specified by evaluating the given expression
from left to right, until the outcome is known left hand side false for and operations or tur for or
then moves on to next file. Searches for files. Global options always return true the maxdepth 1 checks 
how many levels of directory below the starting point. Ctime n, where n is 1 checks if status was last 
changed n*24 hours ago. Same with mtime -n where n is one checks if the file has been modified by n*24 
housr ago. The o is the or which says expr1 or expr2 so expr2 is not evaluated if expr1 is.
